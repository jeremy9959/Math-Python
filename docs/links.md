## Resources

Python is ubiquitous and there are many available resources. There are many resources
on the [Python Beginners Page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/.) Note however that you should install the Anaconda distribution described below rather than using the system python or other installations.

Other references:

1.  *Python Crash Course*, by Eric Matthes.  This is a well-reviewed book that is a reasonably efficient intro to Python.  
It is available free through the [O'Reilly online library via the UConn Library](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664/).

1. *Learning Python*, by Mark Lutz.  Published by O'Reilly. 
[Available free  through the O'Reilly online library via the UConn library.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/) 
This is a 1600 page comprehensive overview of the Python language. 

2. *The Python Tutorial*, from [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) If you know some programming in another language you can quickly get a lot from this. 

3. [Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) from Udemy, written by Jose Portilla.  This is an online course.  
You have to pay for it.  It's always on sale and costs between 5 dollars and 20 dollars.  DO NOT pay more. 
If you want a systematic, clearly taught,online course with a thorough coverage of python this is a good choice.

4. [Fluent Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) by Ramalho.  
Also available free from O'Reilly through the UConn library. If you *know* python, this is a beautiful book about how to take full advantage of the
language features.  It also teaches a lot about the language internals. 

5. [Python for Data Analysis (3E)](https://wesmckinney.com/book/).  This is a book that focuses on using Python for data analysis, 
it includes a quick intro to the language generally and
then a detailed discussion of tools for data manipulation and visualization.

In addition, [this page](links.md) includes links to other documents I have created for other courses on a variety of topics.
